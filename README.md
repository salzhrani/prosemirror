# ProseMirror

This is a well-behaved rich semantic content editor based on
contentEditable, with support for collaborative editing and
customizable document models.

The project page, which has a number of demos, is
[prosemirror.net](http://prosemirror.net). It also has a
[reference manual](http://prosemirror.net/doc/manual.html).

**NOTE:** This project is in *BETA* stage. It isn't thoroughly tested,
and the API might still change across `0.x` releases. You are welcome
to use it, but don't expect it to be very stable yet.

This code is released under an [MIT-style
license](https://github.com/prosemirror/prosemirror/tree/master/LICENSE).
There's a [forum](http://discuss.prosemirror.net) for general
discussion and support requests, and the [Github bug
tracker](https://github.com/prosemirror/prosemirror/issues) is the
place to report issues.

Documentation can be found on [the
website](http://prosemirror.net/doc/manual.html).
